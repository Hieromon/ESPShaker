## ESPShaker
*ESP8266 interactive serial command processor via Arduino core.* [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hieromon/ESPShaker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Hieromon/ESPShaker)   

It is implemented several APIs provided by ESP8266 arduino core so that they can be executed with interactive commands. You can control esp8266 interactively with the command via serial interface. With ESPShaker you can investigate the behavior of ESP8266, without having to write program code every time.  
Since ESPShaker does not use the [AT SDK](http://espressif.com/en/support/download/at) provided by Espressif Systems, it can examine the pure behavior by [ESP8266 arduino core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino).

### Features

* Implemented a commonly used basic WiFi API to the command
* Supports WIFI_AP, WIFI_STA, WIFI_AP_STA mode
* Supports *SmartConfig* with *ESP-TOUCH*
* GPIO port I/O
* SPIFFS file system handling
* Built in Web server with http GET/PUT handling and DNS server, mDNS service
* It can build simple web pages interactively for http response

### Works on

It has tested on NodeMCU v1.0 module (ESP-12E). Other ESP8266 modules will also work, but its sketch size exceeds 370KB. It may not work on prior modules such as ESP-01.  
Required [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) is current upstream at **the 1.8 level or later**, and also [ESP8266 Arduino core 2.3.0](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino).

### Installation

Download ESPShaker file as a zip from this repository, and extract the resulting folder into your Arduino sketch folder and build it with Arduino IDE. In addition to this file, two external libraries are required as [PseudoPWM](https://github.com/Hieromon/PseudoPWM) for LED blinking and [PageBuilder](https://github.com/Hieromon/PageBuilder) for html page dynamic creation.  
Then open the serial monitor and reset the ESP8266 module. If ESPShaker is working properly the current WiFi status will be displayed on the serial monitor. The serial monitor's baudrate is 115200 bps.

### Usage

What you need to recognize is that the API sequence is important for proper communication with ESP8266. In other words, you can explore the error caused by the wrong sequence of the owned code. It will also be useful for analysis of unexpected return codes.  
Usage is simple. Connect ESP8266 module to PC and start the serial monitor. Then enter the following command. A specific API is called and its response is displayed on the serial monitor. ESPShaker also works with other serial terminal utilities. Local echo setting is needed.

#### General commands sequence

#### Commands

##### Syntax

```
command [operand [...]]
```
Enter `command` and `operand` separated by blanks. Depending on the command, it may need to specify more than one operand. The command terminated by `LF` code (\n). Therefore, it is necessary to terminate the serial monitor transmission with LF by `ENTER` key.

   Configure IPs of AP mode operation.
   ```
   apconfig [AP_IP] [GW_IP] [NETMASK]
   ```
   `AP_IP` : AP's local IP address. If not specified, **192.168.4.1** is assumed as the default.  
   `GW_IP` : Gateway IP adderss. If not specified, **192.168.4.1** is assumed as the default.  
   `NETMASK` : Subnet mask. If not specified, **255.255.255.0** is assumed as the default.

2. **autoconnect**  
   Set the ESP8266 Station to connect to the AP (whose ID is cached) automatically or not when powered on.
   ```
   autoconnect on | off
   ```
   `on` : Auto-connect on.  
   `off` : Auto-connect off.

3. **begin**  
   Connect to the AP and starts working the WiFi station. Specified `SSID` and `PASSPHRASE` would be saved to the flash in ESP8266 module.  
   ```
   begin [SSID [PASSPHRASE]]
   ```
   `SSID` : SSID that should be connected.  
   `PASSPHRASE` : Passphrase.  
   If `SSID` or `PASSPHRASE` omitted, the previous value in the flash will be used.

4. **discon**  
   Disconnects Wi-Fi Station from AP.
   ```
   discon
   ```

5. **event**  
   Detects events with **WiFi.onEvent** method and displays.
   ```
   event on | off
   ```
   `on` : Displays that an event has occurred.  
   `off` : No happens at events, but the callback on **onEvent** remains yet.  
   When an event occurs, its message would be displayed as the below.  

   > \> softap esp8266ap 12345678  
   > \> event on  
   > [event]:7 (WIFI_EVENT_SOFTAPMODE_PROBEREQRECVED)  
   > [event]:7 (WIFI_EVENT_SOFTAPMODE_PROBEREQRECVED)  
   > ... WiFi client was connected.  
   > [event]:5 (WIFI_EVENT_SOFTAPMODE_STACONNECTED)  

6. **fs**  
   Handles SPIFFS file system.
   ```
   fs start
   fs dir | info
   fs format
   fs file PATH
   fs remove PATH
   fs rename PATH NEW_PATH
   ```
   + `fs start` : Mounts SPIFFS file system and starts FS API. Just launching ESPShaker does not mount SPIFFS. It is necessary to mount it with **fs start** command before starting FS operation.  
   + `fs dir | info` command displays the information of directory or file system.  
     + `dir` : Display directory list.  
     + `info` : Display the file system information.  
   + `fs format` : Formats the file system.  
   + `fs file PATH` : Reads from file specified `PATH` and displays read data.  
   + `fs remove PATH` : Remove file specified `PATH`.  
   + `fs rename PATH NEW_PATH` :  Rename file specified `PATH` to `NEW_PATH`.
   
7. **gpio**  
   Gets or sets GPIO port value. 
   ```
   gpio get PORT_NUM
   gpio set PORT_NUM low | high
   ```
   <img  align="right" alt="esp12_pins" width="320" src="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/esp12.png">`gpio` command operates on the specified GPIO. It is available 0 (**GPIO0**) to 16 (**GPIO16**) but there are limitations. The following is a quote from [ESP8266 Arduino Core's documentation](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#digital-io):  
   > The diagram below shows pin mapping for the popular ESP-12 module. Digital pins 6â€”11 are not shown on this diagram because they are used to connect flash memory chip on most modules. Trying to use these pins as IOs will likely cause the program to crash.  

   So 6 to 11 can not be specified for safety reasons.  
   + `get PORT_NUM` : Reads the status of GPIO specified `PORT_NUM`. The port value is read digitally and is either `LOW` or `HIGH`. At that time the **pinMmode** is not changed.  
   + `set PORT_NUM low | high` : Sets the specified `PORT_NUM` to `low` or `high`.

8. **http**  
   Issues the GET method to specified Web site or define web page as plain texts.
   ```
   http get URL
   http on URI PAGE_CONTENT
   ```
   + `http get` command issues a GET method to the URL and displays the response of the content including the header from server.  
   `URL` : Specify url to GET like `http://www.example.com/bar.html`.  
   + `http on` command dynamically creates a simple web page consisting only of text with the following operands.  
   `URI` : Specify uri of the simple web page to be created.  
   `PAGE_CONTENT` : A page content text. However, it can include simple HTML tags as `<p>`, `<b>`.  
   + e.g.  
     + `http get http://www.google.com/` will display the response from the google server. At this time, ESP8266 module must be connected to Internet via the other AP with STA mode or AP_STA mode.  
     + `http on /hello Hello, world!` creates 'Hello, world!' page in the internal Web server of ESPShaker. When a client like smartphone accesses to uri of ESPShaker which running in AP mode (e.g. `http://192.168.4.1/hello`), it should see the `Hello, world!` created by `http on` command.

9. **mode**  
   Set Wi-Fi working mode to Station mode (WIFI_STA), SoftAP (WIFI_AP) or Station + SoftAP (WIFI_APSTA), and save it in flash. Immediately after resetting, the default mode is SoftAP mode.
   ```
   mode ap | sta | apsta | off
   ```
   `ap` :  Set WIFI_AP mode.  
   `sta`  : Set WIFI_STA mode.  
   `apsta` : Set WIFI_APSTA mode.  
   `off` : Shutdown Wi-Fi working.  

10. **reset**  
    Reset the module.
    ```
    reset
    ```
    This command invokes `ESP.reset()` function.

11. **scan**  
   Scan all available APs.
   ```
   scan
   ```

12. **show**  
   Display current module saved values as follows.  
   ```
   show
   ```
   The show command allows displaying the following information.  
   + Auto-connect setting.  
   + Host name.  
   + SoftAP MAC Address.  
   + SoftAP IP address.  
   + Local MAC Address.
   + Station local IP address.  
   + Gateway IP address.  
   + Subnet mask.  
   + Saved SSID.  
   + Saved PSK.  
   + Chip configuration.

13. **sleep**  
    Set sleep mode or embarks a deep sleep.
    ```
    sleep none | light | modem
    sleep deep SLEEP_TIME
    ```
    - `sleep` command sets wifi sleep type for power saving.
      - `none` :  Disable power saving.
      - `light` : Enable Light-sleep mode.
      - `modem` : Enable Modem-sleep mode. 
    - `sleep deep` command invokes **ESP.deepSleep** API. It automatically wakes up when `SLEEP_TIME` out.  
     Upon waking up, ESP8266 boots up from setup(), but *GPIO16* and *RST* must be connected. For reference, *GPIO16* is assigned to *D0* on **ESP-12** (NodeMCU) and is **not connected** to external pin with **ESP-01**.
      - `SLEEP_TIME` : Time from deep sleep to waking up (in microseconds unit).  

14. **smartconfig**  
   Start or stop Smart Config by ESP-TOUCH.<img  align="right" alt="esp-touch" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12591771/33641022-18f32c64-da77-11e7-8492-5460b78d4466.png">
   ```
   smartconfig start | stop | done
   ```
   The *Smart Config* is based on the [ESP-TOUCH](http://espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-touch/resources) protocol developed by Espressif Systems. It is seamlessly configure Wi-Fi devices to connect to the router.  
   ESP-TOUCH Apps for smartphone are released iOS and Android both. *ESP8266 SmartConfig* for iOS is [here](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/espressif-esptouch/id1071176700) and for Android is [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmmakerclub.iot.esptouch). So it can be established ESP8266 to the new AP which is connected with smartphone already.
